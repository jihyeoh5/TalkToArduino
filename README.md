# TalkToArduino
Light Up Arduino LEDs retrieves data from the SHARCNET server. This data includes the submitted file, or job, titles and the status of the jobs (i.e. Done, Running, or in Queue). Then, the data is grouped into lists that correspond to the job titles and further grouped into the type of calulation it has or is undergoing. For example, a job title such as "5-Fluorocytosine_4W_349_pm6" tells the reader that the file is composed of a 5-fluorocytosine molecule surrounded by 4 water molecules, it is the 349th file of this nature, and it was set up to undergo a pm6 optimization calculuation. This job would then be included in a list called "5-Fluorocytosine_4W" and, more specifically, a nested list called "pm6". All other 348 files of the type "5-Fluorocytosine_4W" would also be placed in the "5-Fluorocytosine_4W" list. After data from the server is placed into organized lists, this is relayed to Python_and_Arduno_Setup which deciphers which LEDs to light up. The Arduino can display data for 6 different lists which are controlled by pushbuttons. When a button is pushed, the Arduino determines which list to retrieve data from, and it will display through LEDs the status of the jobs for all 5 types of calculation in that list. If the files are done, it will display an on-going green light. If the files are running, the LED will blink quickly. If the files are in queue, the LED will blink slowly.
